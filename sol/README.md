# Solidity Testing

You can see there is a smart contract called, `HIDVesting.sol` in the `contract` folder.

You have to do the following :

1. Understand what this contract is doing.(*hint: its a vesting contract*)
2. Try to find out if there is any bug - syntatical or logical.
3. This is incomplete code, see how you can improve this contract. 


Extra miles

1. Deploy on test net (ropstan , kovan etc) and give us the contract url.
2. Writing a few testcases would definitely add more points.
